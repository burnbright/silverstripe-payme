# SilverStripe 'Pay Me' Module

Provides a way to receive payments via various payment providers within a SilverStripe website.


This module has begun as an aid in the development of the new [SilverStripe Omnipay](https://github.com/burnbright/silverstripe-omnipay) integration module.
It has potential to be developed further.
